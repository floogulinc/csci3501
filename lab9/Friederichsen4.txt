The second language does satisfy the pumping lemma with length m â‰¥ 3.
I tested with m = 3 and m = 4.
It can be pumped up when y two or more a's or two or more b's.
This language seems to be regular. 
It makes sense because you can build a DFA/regex for it, 
here is a regex converted from a DFA I made for the language:
(aa)*(a+abb(bb)*)
