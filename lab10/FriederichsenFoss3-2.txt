We found that the second example (the eighth language in the list) is context-free. 
We used a m value of 4 and the computer selected the word "aaaabbbbccccddddd".
We found a decomposition that sets v to only b and y to only c and the remaining non-pumped b's and c's are equal (3). 
This means that we will pump both b's and c's equally so the number of them will always be equal and the order won't change, satisfying the language definition.
